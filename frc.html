												<h4>Director of Outreach</h4>
												<p>Serving as Director of Outreach of Valkyrie Robotics (FRC #299). I help reach out to spread the joy of learning and STEM throughout my community. I have planned and volunteered for outreach events/demos at local elementary and middle schools, represented the team at technology fairs such as Maker Faire, and communicated and planned logistics for future events. I also assist the management of team operations, including finance, marketing, and media.</p>

												<h4>Electrical and Software Lead</h4>
												<p>Led a group of 30+ software, hardware, and wiring team members for the Monta Vista Robotics Team (FRC #115). I was in charge of writing code for several subsystems of the robot (including the Drive Train and climber), delegating subsystem code to others, and organizing/maintaining code that went onto the robot from GitHub. Additionally, I led training sessions to teach 15-20 new members about the electrical aspect of robots and software design. I also helped with the wiring of several subsystems of the robot, including the Drive Train and climber. This robot went on to win 2nd place in its division at the National Championships in 2017.</p>
